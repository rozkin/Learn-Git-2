    <h2>Ain't your mama</h2>
    <h3>by Jennifer Lopez</h3>
      <p>I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama<br>
        I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama<br>
        I ain't your mama, boy, I ain't your mama<br>
        When you're gon' get your act together?<br>
        I ain't your mama<br>
        No, I ain't your mama<br>
        No, I ain't your mama, no</p>

      <p>Wake up, rise and shine<br>
        Let's get to work on time<br>
        No more playing video games<br>
        Things are about to change, 'round here, 'round here<br>
      </p>
      <p>We used to be crazy in love<br>
        Can we go back to how it was?<br>
        When did you get too comfortable?<br>
        'Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that<br>
        Just remember that, hey</p>
      </p>
